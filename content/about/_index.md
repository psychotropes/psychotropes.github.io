# About Me!

I'm John (Ioannis) Torakis. A student of BSc Psychology!

The [PsychoTropes.wiki](https://PsychoTropes.wiki) page will contain all essays I have worked with through my studies. It might also contain some notes that help me study and maybe some thoughts.

I double in Psychology as my main occupation (and hobby) is IT Security and Coding. 
You could read more about my take on *computer stuff* in my other blog, called [Securosophy](https://securosophy.com/), which comes with a strong influence from Psychology and Philosophy.

Also, as I tend to code my way through things, I code this blog myself (with [*Github Pages*](https://github.com/psychotropes/psychotropes.github.io) and [*Hugo Book Theme*](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/)), including some CSS and JavaScript code for styling pages with the [7th edition of *American Psychological Association* (APA) style](https://www.apa.org/support/apa-style), which can be found and (freely re-used) [here](https://github.com/psychotropes/psychotropes.github.io/tree/main/static/apastyle).
